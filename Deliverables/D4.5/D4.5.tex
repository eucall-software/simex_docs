\section*{Abstract}
%
This report details validation and benchmark studies of the experiment simulation capabilities
developed in EUCALL's workpackage 4 (SIMEX). Where available, we compare our
simulations to experimental data. In other cases, we compare simulations with
simulations, using either different implementations of the same modeling
approach or two simulations of varying degree of accuracy (e.g. 1D vs. 2D
radiation hydrodynamics). The second part contains HPC benchmarks of selected
simulation codes which present performance bottlenecks in the respective
simulation pipeline.

\section{Validation}%
\subsection{Single--particle coherent diffractive imaging\label{sec:single_particle_imaging}}
We present two study cases where we validate and benchmark individual simulation
modules as well as an entire start--to--end simulation toolchain with
experimental data. In the first case, we compare simulated and measured 2D
diffraction data from the Rice Dwarf Virus \cite{Munke2016}, in the second case
we compare 3D molecular structures reconstructed from simulated diffraction data
to the original 3D model reconstructed from NMR \cite{Schlessman1998}
measurements.
\subsubsection{Validation of single--particle imaging using raw diffraction data }
Our validation of the single--particle imaging simulation toolchain in SIMEX
uses diffraction data measured at the AMO endstation at
\SI{1.6}{\kilo\electronvolt} photon energy.

\subsubsection{Validation of the single--particle imaging simulation toolchain
using reconstructed density profiles}%
Coherent diffraction from single proteins has been simulated using the
\textit{simS2E} suite \cite{Yoon2016}. Of the order 200000 diffraction images,
sampling the FEL spectral and temporal fluctuations, including focussing
mirror height profiles, radiation damage processes (ionization and atomic
displacement), were then fed into computational reconstruction using the
Expand--Maximize--Compress (EMC) algorithm for orientation and the
Difference Map (DM) algorithm to solve the phase problem. The resulting 3D
electron density maps could then be compared to the PDB model that was used as
a sample specification in the simulation. The structure in the PDB had been
measured with the NMR method. We reproduce below the corresponding figures
from the original article by Yoon et al.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,angle=0,clip]{srep24791-f7}

  \caption{Electron densities of the average reconstruction at the 5\% and 15\%
    levels (yellow and purple, respectively) from simulated diffraction data with
    (top row) and without (bottom row) Compton scattering and for two different
    XFEL pulse durations. The protein's low--resolution features (original PDB
    shown on left-hand-side) were recovered in
    all four cases, with surface electron densities showing the most variation and
    hence least certainty. Loss of reproducible density is more severe in the
    30 fs case due to greater damage. Degradation of surface contrast is
    expected in
    previous damage--only simulations and may, in future studies, be tampered by a
    sacrificial water layer\cite{Hau-Riege2004}. Reproduced

\end{figure}
The results demonstrate the predictive power of our start--to--end simulation
toolchain. All main features of the protein were reproduced. Regions close to
the surface show enhanced displacement and poorer agreement with the
experimental data due to radiation damage.

\subsection{Coherent Nanocrystal diffraction\label{sec:coherent_nanocrystal_diffraction}}
Two codes integrated in \textit{simex\_platform} can be used to model x--ray
diffraction from crystalline samples. The first code is \textit{singfel},
which calculates the diffraction from given atomic coordinates and scattering
formfactors. The second code is \textit{pattern\_sim} (part of
\textit{crystfel}) \cite{White2012}, which
reads only the crystallographic unit cell and form factors plus information
about the point group and sample size to calculate the diffraction
pattern consisting of Bragg spots and incoherent contributions.
\textit{singfel} reads the structure of the entire nanocrystal, thus providing
more flexibility to account for radiation damage effects which break the
translational symmetry of the sample.

We validate both codes against the code \textit{mercury} \cite{Macrae2008} of the
Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC). Fig.~\ref{fig:Fe2O3_vpp_model_vs_model} shows the simulated
powder diffraction pattern up for \textit{singFEL} vs. \textit{mercury} (top)
and for \textit{pattern\_sim} vs. \textit{mercury} (bottom). The sample is a
\SI{18}{\nano\metre} sized fcc crystal of
Fe\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3}. In both cases, the
positions of Bragg peaks produced by SIMEX correspond to the reference
simulation. In general, the peak amplitudes differ between the SIMEX simulations and the
reference model, while the \textit{singFEL} results are in better agreement to the
reference model than the \textit{pattern\_sim} results. This difference between
\textit{singFEL} and \textit{pattern\_sim} can be attributed to the more
precise and well validated model for the form factors, calculated with the code \textit{XATOM}
\cite{Son2011}. Note that the \textit{singFEL} calculation contains a
large signal at small angles, this has been removed in the \textit{pattern\_sim}
calculation. These simulations were used to support the feasibility of a
experiment proposed at European XFEL.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth,angle=0,clip]{Fe2O3_vpp_mercury_vs_simex}

  \caption{Simulated powder diffraction patterns (blue lines) for nanocrystalline fcc Fe\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3}
  using the diffraction modules \textit{singfel} (top) and \textit{pattern\_sim}
  (bottom) compared to reference calculations for an infinite fcc lattice
    using the code \textit{mercury} (orange curve).}
    \label{fig:Fe2O3_vpp_model_vs_model}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


In the following, we will
apply the \textit{singFEL} module for diffraction simulations and compare to
experimental data.
Fig.~\ref{fig:C60_virtual_powder_data_vs_models} compares \textit{singfel}
simulations to diffraction data from
an experiment at the CXI endstation at LCLS in a virtual powder representation.
The sample is fcc nanocrystalline C\textsubscript{60}. Bragg peaks were identified in each measured
2D diffraction pattern using the \textit{psana} \cite{psana_www} peak finder
and histogrammed according to the peak's
radial distance from the geometrical center of the detector image corresponding
to zero scattering angle.
The histogram (orange bars) is plotted as a function of the Bragg
angle $2\theta$ and compared to a SIMEX simulation using \textit{singfel}
(blue curve) and the \textit{mercury} reference calculation for a perfect
infinite fcc lattice. Similar to the model--vs--model comparison, the agreement
between models and data is overall satisfying, i.e. the peak positions coincide
and the peak amplitudes are close.

\subsection{Imaging of High--Power Laser driven targets\label{sec:high_power_imaging}}
In Deliverable Report D4.3 [!!Deliverable4.3], we presented the interoperability
of X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) and Ultra-High Intensity (UHI) laser pulse
generation, interaction with the target, and generation of a Small-Angle X-ray
Scattering (SAXS) images using the scattering code ParaTAXIS.  A Particle In
Cell (PIC) simulation provides the time evolution of the electron density on
which the XFEL photons are scattered.  We assumed invariance of the target in
propagation direction and simulated the XFEL pulse with $10^{12}$ photons for
which the target is optically thin.  The ion density follows the electron
density as expected for plasma expansion into vacuum.  The SAXS pattern well
resolves the nanometer-scale grating depth and period, taking into account the
target evolution during the interaction time with the laser pulse.  The full
details were reported in [!!Deliverable4.3,!!Deliverable 4.4].  The simulation
parameters match an experiment led by the group of HZDR which was recently
published in [!!1].  In the experiment a silicon grating was irradiated by a
Ti:Sa laser with $400$\,mJ on target and pulse duration $80$\,fs, focus size
$1500\,\mathrm{\mu m^2}$ (FWHM).  The expansion of the grating as a function of
time was measured and is reported in [!!1].
%
%\begin{figure}
  %\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/parataxis_vs_ln04.png}
    %\caption{Comparison between the ParaTAXIS simulated scattering profile (red) and the analytic solution (blue), both based on PIC-simulated data used also in [!!1].
    %The two curves almost perfectly agree in the relative heights of the scattered peaks, the signal in between is larger in the ParaTAXIS simulation due to the finite number of quasi-photons in the simulation.
    %The simulation also agrees reasonably well with the experimental data, taking into account the finite experimental background  and imperfect peak-to-valley aspect ratio of the front side grating, generating imperfect suppression of even scattering peaks. \label{fig:1}}
%\end{figure}
Here we compare the scattering patterns at $t=0$ (i.e. when the laser maximum
has reached the target front surface) between the ParaTAXIS simulation, an
analytic solution and the measurement (see Fig.~\ref{fig:1}).  For optically
thin targets, the scattering pattern of a grating with soft edges can be
described by an analytic equation (see [!!1]).  As an input into this equation
we extract the sharpness of the grating edges from the simulation,
$\sigma\approx 8 nm$ We find a good agreement between the simulation and the
analytic solution, as well as with the experimental curve when we take into
account a few key aspects.  First, we note that the ParaTAXIS simulation gives
the same relative peak heights as the Fourier transform, validating the
simulation.  The signal level between the main peaks is different however due to
the finite number of quasi-photons used in the simulation.  With more simulation
time, this level will further decrease, as this contribution is solely due to
limited sampling of the full parameter space for the quasi-photons and will be
fully extinct in the limit of high photon numbers.  Secondly, the experiment
contains signal from a background contribution, e.g. from plasma self-emission,
bremsstrahlung and 3rd harmonic of the drive laser.  Also, the experiment shows
peaks in between the simulated peak positions, which are due to non-perfect
aspect ratio of the pre-inscribed grating on the target surface.  In the
simulated case, the initial peak-to-valley aspect ratio is 1:1, while in the
experiment due to production uncertainties this is not exactly the case.
Besides this difference the experimental results are reproduced well by the
simulation.

\subsection{Warm dense matter x--ray absorption spectroscopy\label{sec:warm_dense_matter_spectroscopy}}
Interaction of high--energy optical laser pulses with solid targets and shock
compression is modeled with radiation--hydrodynamics (RH) simulations using
either 1D (\textit{Esther} \cite{Colombier2005})
or 2D (\textit{Multi2D} \cite{Ramis2009}) RH implementations.
The resulting profiles for mass density, temperature,
ionization, and pressure are then fed into an electronic structure calculation.
Finally, a real--space Green function code (e.g. FEFF \cite{Rehr2009} calculates the x--ray absorption
spectrum. At this point, the spectrum and intensity distribution of the x--ray
probe beam, delivered by x--ray raytracing simulations can be taken into
account. The workflow, supported by SIMEX is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:xas_workflow}.

%
In Fig.~\ref{fig:xas_exp_vs_AI}, we show experimental EXAFS
spectra, measured at beamline ID24 at ESRF \cite{Torchio2016} compared to ab--initio
simulations assuming pressure and temperature conditions similar to those of
the experiment, which were modelled with RH simulations. The experimental spectra
measured at \SI{500}{\giga\pascal} pressure and \SI{1.7e4}{\kelvin} temperature
(upper left) and at \SI{120}{\giga\pascal} pressure and \SI{2.7e3}{\kelvin}
temperature (lower left), respectively, are shown in together with spectra
measured at ambient conditions (black curve). The labels a,b,c, and d mark points
in the spectrum, where the strongly compressed case shows significant
differences with respect to the ambient case. At increased pressure, a shift of
the K--edge onset to smaller energie is found, as well as a steepening of the
edge profile in the lower half of the edge retion
(\SI{<7.12}{\kilo\electronvolt}), whereas the absorption rises less steeply with respect to the
ambient case in the upper half of the edge (\SI{>7.12}{\kilo\electronvolt}).
The modelled spectra reproduce
these differences qualitatively. A more quantitative analysis and comparison
beteen theory and experiment is still outstanding.
%

We also compared 1D RH simulations for the (peak??) pressure as a function
of energy on target in the case of molybdenum. Fig.~\ref{fig:rh_1d_vs_exp}
shows three measured datasets (dots) differing the the thickness of the phase plate
used to smoothen the intensity distribution over the focal spot and the pump
pulse duration. The solid lines mark the RH simulations, systematically
overestimating the pressure. This is a typical artifact of 1D RH simulations.
The systematic offset between model and data could be used to define a heuristic
correction factor to apply to 1D simulation data.

\section{High Performance Computing Benchmarks}
\subsection{Single--particle imaging simulation pipeline}
The single--particle imaging simulatoin pipeline consists of
\begin{enumerate}
  \item pulse propagation
  \item photon--matter interaction
  \item diffraction
  \item detector response (optional)
\end{enumerate}

Each of these modules have very different and demanding computational resource
requirements. We present benchmarking results for few selected modules which
represent performance bottlenecks in the simulation pipeline.

\subsubsection{Wavefront propagation}
The wavefront propagation utilizes the software Synchrotron Radiation Workshop
(SRW), a legacy C library with historically very limited options for
parallelization. Recently, there have been three major developments:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Insertion of openMP macros to enable shared--memory parallelism
  \item Multicore parallel execution of propagation of multiple FEL source
    pulses.
  \item MPI parallel calculation of independent coherent modes for partially
    coherent wavefront propagation.
\end{enumerate}
%
1) and 2) have been realized in SIMEX, 3) is an independent development in the radiation source
simulation and propagation framework SiRepo
\url{www.github.com/radiasoft/sirepo}. Fig.~\ref{fig:srw_speedup} shows the
speedup of a single SRW wavefront propagation resulting from the insertion of
openMP pragmas in the SRW source code.

\end{table}
%
\subsubsection{Radiation damage}
The radiation damage module is by far the most compute intensive part of the SPI
pipeline, determining $\approx 90\%$ of the total wall time of one
start--to--end propagation. The code \textit{xmdyn and xatom}, provided by
CFEL, DESY \cite{Jurek2016} utilizes GPGPU cards, MPI or shared memory
parallelism are currently not implemented, only one GPGPU card can
be utilized at a time. Our benchmarks therefore compare the performance on
different GPGPU variants. The test case is a trajectory of the 2NIP protein
irradiated by a \SI{10}{\femto\second} (FWHM) pulse of
\SI{5}{\kilo\electronvolt} FEL photons (pulse energy \SI{\approx 1}{\milli\joule}).

%
\subsubsection{Diffraction}
%
Diffraction calculations are performed with the code \textit{pysingfel}. To
enhance performance, this code uses the \textit{numba} library to facilitate
just--in--time compilation for available hardware of compute intensive parts.
In the following we benchmark the performance of a \textit{pysingfel} diffraction
calculation with an unperturbed protein diffracting a parametrized FEL beam of
\SI{5}{\kilo\electronvolt} photon energy into a detector of 1024x1024 pixels.

\section{JupyterHub as a Platform for Data Analysis as a Service}
\subsection{Introduction}
For the task 4.3.2 \textit{Provide a framework towards a service to users [\dots\ ] } we set up an instance of \textit{JupyterHub} for the users of the \textit{Maxwell Cluster} at \textsc{DESY}.
Users of the \textit{SIMEX} code are familiar with the computing environment at \textsc{DESY} and use the cluster in many ways.
To run heavy computations on the cluster users have to submit a job to \textit{SLURM} which will then allocate ressources to the users' jobs and run them.
This is a well-established workflow for simulations and data reduction pipelines where the result of the
computation can be delayed by days from the time of submission.
For other use-cases though, users need near to instantaneous feedback from their input.
This is what \textit{iPython} does. It is a interactive python shell that evaluates commands - or multi line command blocks - one by one and returns a result direcrtly.
The iPython notebook was a web-based frontend to iPython that was then renamed into the Jupyter Notebook after other backends became popular.
Doing work with the Jupyter Notebook on a remote server or a High Performance Cluster requires a few steps, setting up an SSH Tunnel with port forwarding, logging onto the server and then starting the notebook manually.
If a user wants more advanced features like password protection
The JupyterHub is a development that is meant for environments where many users need to access a Jupyter Notebook and all those steps are done automatically and users only need to log in with their username and password.

\subsection{Features of the JupyterHub at DESY}
The JupyterHub we set up uses a lot of infrastructure already available at DESY. In the following we explain how they were included into an instance to make data analysis more convenient.
Features of the \textit{JupyterHub} Instance include:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Encryption via SSL using an DFN (Deutsches Forschungsnetzwerk) inheritance certificate to provide user data security
 \item Integration into the existing LDAP authentication at DESY
 \item Connection to the SLURM ressource manager on the Maxwell Cluster
 \item Customization of the Notebook Spawner to provide access to the GPFS file system
 \item Addition of Various Python Kernel Versions and other demanded languages such as R \& bash kernels
 \item Using the Maxwell Cluster as an infrastructure to provide computing power
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Using the JupyterHub and SimEx}
To use the JupyterHub at DESY one has to visit the website
\begin{verbatim}
 https://max-jhub.desy.de
\end{verbatim}
while on the DESY-XFEL Network.
Opening the ports to the Internet is work in progress and needs the server to be isolated in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which is a different network section and has special firewall rules.
Users then see the scrren shown in fig.~\ref{fig:jhub_start} which has been customized to show the DESY Logo and shows the \textit{Secure} Website lock so User know their data is protected.
Users then have to enter their DESY credentials which are passed to the LDAP server to check if the password is correct.

\end{figure}

After login on, users are presented with a choice, shown in fig.~\ref{fig:jhub_spawn}, where their notebook should run.
There is a shared partition where users can

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{After the login using the DESY credentials was successful, the user has multiple options to select from for the spawner to start the notebook server}
  \label{fig:jhub_spawn}
\end{figure}

Once the user has selected the partition a SLUM job is submitted that starts the Notebook Server and a connection is established and users see the screen depicted in fig.~\ref{fig:jhub_work}. On the right panel the options to start are shown. This is neccessary so users have access to their group specific partition if they want to do interactive computations with a full node and not just sharing ressources.

Once the server is started and and a notebook is openend, users of the \textit{SimEx} code can execute code cells
to import the module and functions they use in their regular python-driven workflow they are used to without the Jupyter Notebook, as is shown in fig.~\ref{fig:simex_import}.
The advantage is now that plots can be displayed inline, so no X-forwarding is needed.
Also, the Jupyter Notebook supports cells with \textit{Markdown} format, so documenting the work and coding progress
can be done by adding cells with headings, text and even \LaTeX style text blocks.
