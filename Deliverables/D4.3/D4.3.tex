\section*{Abstract}\label{sec:summary}
 We report five documented examples demonstrating the interoperability of
 simulation workflows in SIMEX. A first usage example has been presented in
Milestone M4.2~\cite{EUCALL_SIMEX_M4.2}.

\section{Introduction}
The following examples demonstrate the functionality and interoperability of all
simulation tools as demanded in Task 4.2.2.:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Simulation of diffraction of coherent x--rays delivered by an
    \gls{xfel}
    from high energy density matter created by short--pulse
    laser matter interaction (as detailed in Deliverable D4.1)
  \item Simulation of \gls{xafs} from long--pulse laser
    shocked warm dense matter at the synchrotron light source ESRF (as detailed
    in Deliverable D4.2).
  \item Coherent diffraction imaging of protein crystals
  \item X--ray Thomson Scattering from warm dense plasmas
  \item Laser--wakefield acceleration based coherent light sources
\end{enumerate}
%

Table~\ref{tab:simulation_capabilities} summarizes the available simulation
modules, the interfaced backengine simulation codes, and the relevant sections
of this report and external references where example applications can be found.

User interfaces for the simulation codes, as well
as data interfaces and file format converters are implemented in the simulation
environment \textit{simex\_platform}. Version 0.3.3~\cite{simex0.3.3} of the
software was released on September 22, 2017 in fulfillment of Milestone M4.3
\cite{EUCALL_SIMEX_M4.3}.

\section{\Gls{xafs}\label{sec:xafs}}
%
We have executed the simulations outlined in Deliverable
4.2\cite{EUCALL_SIMEX_D4.2}, describing an \gls{xafs} experiment on shock compressed
solid matter. There are three areas of simulation that are considered to describe the
whole source-to-end experiment: X-ray source \& ray tracing, long pulse photon-matter
interaction, and X-ray absorption modelling. Currently, the simulations of X-ray
source/X-ray tracing and XAS modelling are standalone simulations that provide
important information for the long pulse hydrocode simulations. Information
such as X-ray beam size on sample, will influence the laser conditions that can
be accepted for hydrocode simulation (the laser spot must be larger than the
X-ray spot size).

\href{https://www.github.com/eucall-software/simex_platform/wiki/Esther-Hydrocode-Tutorial}{A
documented example workflow} is provided to demonstrate the usability of the
radiation--hydrodynamics simulation capabilities in \textit{simex\_platform}. It
shows how to optimize the target geometry (i.e. the thickness of the ablator
material) to maximize the data output, making use of the openPMD metadata
standard to facilitate transferability among involved simulation codes and
data analysis and visualisation tools.

\section{Coherent diffraction from protein nano--crystals\label{sec:protein_sfx}}
In an
\href{https://github.com/eucall-software/simex_platform/wiki/Tutorial-on-nano-crystal-diffraction}{online
tutorial}, we demonstrate the usage of \textit{simex\_platform} to simulate
coherent diffraction of XFEL photons from nano--metre scale crystalline samples.
As in the other XFEL applications (see Sec.~\ref{sec:plasma_diffraction} and
Sec.~\ref{sec:xrts} as well as the first demonstration example in Milestone
M4.2 \cite{EUCALL_SIMEX_M4.2}), the source wavefront is queried from the
\href{https://in.xfel.eu/xpd}{XFEL Pulses Database XPD} and propagated to the
sample interaction point in the focus of the SPB--SFX instrument by means of
the coherent wavefront propagation code library WPG. Owing to the well defined
data interfaces and file format adaptors in \textit{simex\_platform}, passing the
wavefront data to the crystal diffraction code is straightforward. We employ the
code \textit{pattern\_sim} which is part of the crystallography software suite
\textit{CrystFEL} \cite{White2012}, available as open source from the
\href{https://www.desy.de/~twhite/crystfel}{CrystFEL website}. The
corresponding \textit{Calculator} in \textit{simex\_platform} is the
\href{https://eucall-software.github.io/simex_platform/#SimEx.Calculators.CrystFELPhotonDiffractor.CrystFELPhotonDiffractor}{\textit{CrystFELPhotonDiffractor}}.
The \textit{CrystFELPhotonDiffractor} extracts the mean photon energy, the energy
spectrum, the beam divergence, the beam diameter, and other beam characteristics
from the wavefront data. The sample must be specified by a PDB code along
with information about the size of the nano--crystal, e.g. the extension in x,y,
and z directions. By default, the sample geometry is rotated in space via a
randomly chosen rotation operator to mimic the unknown orientation of the sample
in the experiment. Each simulated pattern is stored in a separate hdf5 file.
After the calculation, one master hdf5 file is generated which links to the
individual patterns and which has the same hierarchy as output generated e.g. by
the
\href{https://eucall-software.github.io/simex_platform/#SimEx.Calculators.SingFELPhotonDiffractor.SingFELPhotonDiffractor}{\textit{SingFELPhotonDiffractor}}
for single particle coherent diffraction. This in turn ensures that the same
visualization tools (e.g.
\href{https://eucall-software.github.io/simex_platform/#SimEx.Analysis.DiffractionAnalysis.DiffractionAnalysis}{\textit{DiffractionAnalysis}})
can be applied to crystal diffraction data and to single particle diffraction
data.
%
\section{Plasma X--ray Thomson Scattering\label{sec:xrts}}
%
\gls{xrts}~\cite{Glenzer2009,Fortmann2009d} has
become an important method for the diagnosis of matter at extreme conditions of
temperature and density. These quantities can be inferred from the spectrally
resolved scattering intensity if the spectrum was measured with high resolution.
The resolution primarily depends on the detector's point spread function, the
energy resolution of the dispersive element, and on the spectral width of
the probe radiation. Complex structured source spectra, e.g. K--shell multiplets
\cite{Lee2009a} or saturated SASE (self--amplified spontaneous emission) spectra
limit the accuracy to which plasma properties can be measured.

\gls{xrts} can now be simulated within \textit{simex\_platform}. The corresponding
\textit{Calculator} is the
\href{https://eucall-software.github.io/simex_platform/#SimEx.Calculators.PlasmaXRTSCalculator.PlasmaXRTSCalculator}{\textit{PlasmaXRTSCalculator}},
the backengine simulation code is called \textit{xrs} and can be obtained by
request from the maintainers of \textit{simex\_platform}. The
\href{https://eucall-software.github.io/simex_platform/#SimEx.Calculators.PlasmaXRTSCalculator.PlasmaXRTSCalculator}{\textit{PlasmaXRTSCalculator}}
accepts wavefront data from the
\href{https://eucall-software.github.io/simex_platform/#SimEx.Calculators.XFELPhotonPropagator.XFELPhotonPropagator}{\textit{XFELPhotonPropagator}}
from which it will extract the power spectrum of the scattering photons and
convolute it with the dynamic structure factor coming from the \textit{xrs}
code.

A tutorial and example demonstration has been added to the
\href{https://github.com/eucall-software/simex_platform/wiki/Tutorial_XRTS}{\textit{simex\_platform}
wiki}. It explains how to setup the source, propagation and \gls{xrts} calculation
to generate scattering spectra with explicit account for the source spectrum.

Fig.~\ref{fig:xrts_spectrum_and_source} demonstrates the impact of a broad SASE
spectrum on the simulated \gls{xrts} spectrum. Here, we used a propagated
wavefront from the SASE1 beamline at European XFEL of \SI{3}{\femto\second}
duration and \SI{5}{\kilo\electronvolt} photon energy. The simulation of the FEL
source was performed at high saturation leading to the numerous SASE spikes and
rather broad spectral width of the x--ray probe.

  \caption{(a) \gls{xrts} spectrum the total scattering as well as contributions

feature and smears our the inelastic features.}

\end{figure}

In Ref.~\cite{Rozmus2017_submitted}, the theoretical models to describe
scattering from weakly collisional plasmas implemented in \textit{xrs} are
benchmarked against a plasma kinetic model. A second publication, analysing the
range of applicability of the so--called impulse approximation for Compton
scattering from bound states is currently in preparation \cite{Bell2017_prep}.

\section{Laser--plasma accelerator driven FEL source}\label{sec:lwfa_source}
%
Simulations of compact coherent x--ray sources based on the mechanism of
electron laser wakefield acceleration  couple particle--in--cell
simulations to an \gls{fel} code. In our case, we use the \gls{pic} code \textit{PIConGPU}
and the \textit{Genesis} \gls{fel} code, both are publicly available under open source licenses.
\textit{PIConGPU} writes the particle and field data
into a hdf5 file using the openPMD \cite{Huebl2017} metadata standard. A file format conversion utility, which is part of
\textit{simex\_platform} converts the \gls{pic} output to an electron distribution
file (extension .dist) readable by \textit{Genesis}.
