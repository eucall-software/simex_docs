This interfaces was used to investigate the possible 
route for experimental realization of laser plasma accelerator based coherent light source (FELs)\cite{Emma2004}. Since the conventional accelerator has the limit of the
gradient due to the structure surface field limit, the best gradient achieved
now is less than 100MeV/m. Laser plasma accelerators
(LPA)\cite{Leemans2006,Esarey2009,Tajima1979} have the potential to become the next
generation of accelerator facilities reaching field gradients of the order of
\SI{100}{\giga\electronvolt\per\metre}, i.e. up to three orders of magnitude
higher than in conventional linear accelerators. This would reduce construction
and operation costs by comparable orders of magnitude.

\subsection{Start--to--end simulation of LWFA based FELs\label{sec:lwfa_s2e}}
Our simulation setup is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lwfa-setup}; starting from electron
beam generation from a laser plasma source to the generation of femtosecond
and/or attosecond EUV/XUV pulse from the radiation undulator.

In this scheme an intense
(\si{\tera\watt}/\si{\peta\watt} power \textbf{10 TW – 100 TW})
laser is focused onto a gas jet or a gas filled capillary for producing a
relativistic electron beam. Initial energy spread of the electron beam of a
LPA (1-5\%) is typically much larger than that of a LINAC (about 0.05 \%), so
reduction of the slice energy spread is necessary. The electron beam is sent
through a modulator undulator (MU) together with a TW-power laser beam, where
the interaction between the electrons, the magnetic field of the undulator and
the electromagnetic field of the laser introduces a periodic energy modulation
of the electrons. This energy modulation leads to the formation of nanobunches
(ultrashort electron layers). The nanobunched electron beam then passes through
a radiator undulator (RU) consisting of a single or a few periods and creates
EUV/XUV pulses.
%
The SIMEX setup (as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lwfa-setup}) for LPA driven FEL utilizes the PIConGPU simulation code for electron beam generation using the LPA mechanism and further transportation of electron beam to FEL simulation code GENESIS. We show schematically SIMEX tools in Fig.~\ref{fig:lwfa-simulation_loop}, in order to calculate the radiation field from LPA generated electron beam. We start by defining the initial laser-plasma parameters and initial conditions in PIConGPU code using LWFA scheme. PIConGPU which runs on GPU cluster; computes the 6D electron beam distributions at rear side of  plasma in vacuum. The obtained electron beam distribution is transformed via python script to a readable data format (an input data file for GENESIS); which is required to study the electron beam dynamics through the magnetic field distributions in FEL simulation code. The output data file from GENESIS can be further post-processed to calculate and visulaize the radiation field.

\subsection{Laser-plasma accelerator based single-cycle attosecond undulator source}
In parallel, we have studied\footnote{This study was performed in collaboration
with T. Zoltan and Prof. Hebling, both at Pecs University, Hungary.} the feasability of a LWFA based coherent light
source using experimental data for electron wakefield acceleration as input to
the FEL simulation. The FEL simulation used the code \textit{GPT} in this case.
Details are discussed in Ref.~\cite{Tibai2017}.

Fig.~\ref{fig:Tibai2017} displays the simulated waveform (electrical field as
a function of time)  of the generated attosecond
pulse and the beam profile at \SI{60}{\nano\metre} radiation wavelength. The
temporal evolution was measured on the axis of highest intensity, marked by  a
cross in Fig.~\ref{fig:Tibai2017_profile}. In other
wavelengths the shape of the attosecond pulses are nearly identical with the
shape shown in fig (a) so these pulses are carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) controlled, too.
