\section{Conclusion}
Taking everything into consideration, there are lots of issues that remain to be settled. Especially, testing the results for consistency with the expectations and getting rid of smaller problems are task for future work. Furthermore, additional source code needs to be added to handle the interaction-to-photon transition in the \texttt{XCSITPhotonDetector} calculator more appropriately. Simulating each pattern and its intensity matrix on its own instead of summing them up and treating all the patterns as one would also be a valuable feature that can be added. Nevertheless, it was shown, that the current design based on inheritance and polymorphism and by applying boost.python libraries and \texttt{cmake} makefile production is capable of accessing the \texttt{X-CSIT} detector simulation from \texttt{SimEx}.
