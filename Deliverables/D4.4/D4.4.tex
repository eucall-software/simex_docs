\section{Outline}
%
As first applications of our simulation software suite \textit{simex\_platform}
\cite{simex_github, Fortmann-Grote2017a, EUCALL_SIMEX_D4.3}, we have employed the simulation capabilities of
\textit{simex\_platform} \cite{simex_github} to simulate two photon experiments:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Coherent diffraction from high--power laser excited optically thin and
    thick plasmas (plasma sample)
  \item Single particle imaging at the European XFEL (non--plasma sample)
\end{enumerate}
%
In addition, we also report on the integration of detector simulations in
\textit{simex\_platform}.

\section{Plasma sample}
%
In Deliverable Report D4.3~\cite{EUCALL_SIMEX_D4.3}, we present the interoperability of \gls{xfel} and \gls{uhi} laser pulse generation,
interaction with the target, and generation of a \gls{saxs} image using the
scattering code \textit{ParaTAXIS}.

A \gls{pic} simulation provides the time
evolution of the electron density on which the \gls{xfel} photons are scattered. We
assume invariance of the target in propagation direction and simulate the \gls{xfel}
pulse with \num{e12} photons for which the target is optically thin,
see left part of Fig. \ref{fig:scattering}. We further demonstrate
scattering on an optically thick setup by simulating
resonant scattering on the ions of the target. The ion density follows the
electron density as expected for plasma expansion into vacuum\cite{Mora2003},
see right part of Fig. \ref{fig:scattering}.

The signal of the optically thick target is washed out due to
higher scattering probability. In both, the optically thin and the optically
thick case, the
\gls{saxs} pattern well resolves the nanometer--scale grating depth and period, taking
into account the target evolution during the interaction time with the laser
pulse.

    \SI{1.47}{\angstrom}$ and
    \num{e12} photons in the illuminated area. The vertical separation of scattering
    lines corresponds to the grating period of \SI{200}{\nano\metre}, the horizontal to
    the grating depth of \SI{100}{\nano\metre}.

  \label{fig:scattering}
\end{figure}

All density data from the \gls{pic} simulation as well as the \gls{saxs} patterns are
published on Zenodo together with the data format documentation
\cite{Garten2017.zenodo.885033} in partial fulfillment of EUCALL Milestone M4.3
\cite{EUCALL_SIMEX_M4.3}.

\section{Molecular (non--plasma) sample}
Application of \textit{simex\_platform} to single--particle imaging experiments
at the European X--ray Free Electron Laser (SPB--SFX scientific instrument) has
been published as Ref.~\cite{Fortmann-Grote2017}. It is also the basis for an
online tutorial on the
\href{https://www.github.com/eucall-software/simex_platform/wiki/SimEx-Tutorial}{wiki
pages} of \textit{simex\_platform} and it is
discussed in the EUCALL Milestone M4.2~\cite{EUCALL_SIMEX_M4.2} (First example
simulation).
The datasets for coherent diffraction from the protein 2NIP are deposited on
the \href{https://www.zenodo.org/communities/eucall-data}{EUCALL Data
Repository} \cite{Fortmann-Grote2017.zenodo.886087}.

The signal generation for non--plasma samples happens in two steps: First, the
photon--matter interaction module calculates for each time step of the
simulation the atomic positions and the atomic form factors for each
atom in the sample in the field of the x--ray laser. The effect of radiation
damage can be switched on or off in the simulation. In the latter case, the
atoms remain on their initial positions and the form factors correspond to the
atomic ground states.
This information is then
taken in the second step to calculate the scattered intensity as a function of
time for each pixel in the virtual 2D pixel detector. The software package
\textit{pysingfel} \cite{pysingfel_github} implements the scattering formula
\begin{equation}
  I(\mathbf{q}) = \Omega
  \frac{d\sigma_\mathrm{Th}(\theta)}{d\Omega}\langle I_0\rangle\left|
  \sum_i f_i(\mathbf{q})\mathrm{e}^{i\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{R_i}}\right|^2~,
  \label{eqn:scattering_intensity}
\end{equation}
where $d\sigma_\mathrm{Th}/d\Omega$ is the differential Thomson cross
section,
$\langle I_0\rangle$ is the average pulse intensity, $\Omega$ is the solid
angle spanned by the considered detector pixel.
The wavevector $\mathbf{q}$ depends on the detector geometry (distance
$d$ from the sample) and pixel coordinates ($r_x, r_y$) in the detector plane assumed
to be perpendicular to the beam propagation axis and centered such that the
beam axis intersects the detector plane at its origin:
\begin{equation}
  q=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\left(%
  \begin{array}{l}
  \sin(2\theta)\,\cos(\phi)\\
  \sin(2\theta)\,\cos(\phi)\\
  \cos(2\theta)-1
  \end{array}%
  \right) =
  \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\left(%
  \begin{array}{l}
    \frac{r_x}{\sqrt{r_x^2+r_y^2+d^2}}\\
    \frac{r_y}{\sqrt{r_x^2+r_y^2+d^2}}\\
    \frac{d-\sqrt{r_x^2+r_y^2+d^2}}{\sqrt{r_x^2+r_y^2+d^2}}
  \end{array}%
  \right)~.
  \label{eqn:q_components}
\end{equation}
%$q=\left|\mathbf{q}\right| = 4\pi/\lambda\,\sin(\theta)$.
Here, $2\theta=\arctan\left(\frac{r_x^2+r_y^2}{d}\right)$ is the scattering
angle and $\phi=\arctan\left(\frac{r_y}{r_x}\right)$. In this notation, the
pixel solid angle becomes
$\Omega=4\arcsin\left(a^2/\left[ 4(r_x^2+r_y^2+d^2)+a^2 \right]\right)$, with the pixel
width $a$.

In our simulations, $d=\SI{13}{\centi\metre}$. The
detector is a $512\times512$ array of pixels of side length
$a=\SI{200}{\micro\metre}$ corresponding to one quadrant of a 1 megapixel AGIPD
detector \cite{Allahgholi2015} at the SPB--SFX instrument at European XFEL.

We have applied this simulation toolchain to two cases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Diffraction of 5 keV photons from isolated 2NIP molecules and variation
    of the \gls{xfel} pulse duration, published in Ref.~\cite{Fortmann-Grote2017}.
  \item Diffraction of 5 keV photons from hydrated 2NIP molecules and variation
    of the hydration layer thickness, published in
    Ref.~\cite{Fortmann-Grote2017b}.
\end{enumerate}
Fig.~\ref{fig:2nip_diffraction_RD_vs_noRD} shows diffraction patterns from
2NIP with and without radiation damage taken into account in the simulation.
%
\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}
%
Fig.~\ref{fig:2nip_hydration_layer} shows diffraction from the same molecule for
two different hydration layer thicknesses of \SI{3}{\angstrom} (a) and
\SI{10}{\angstrom} (b), respectively.
%
\begin{figure}[ht]

  \caption{Diffraction patterns for 5 keV XFEL photons scattering from a single
    2NIP molecule embedded in a hydration shell of \SI{3}{\angstrom} (a) and
    \SI{10}{\angstrom} (b) thickness.}
  \label{fig:2nip_hydration_layer}
\end{figure}

It can be seen how, qualitatively, the presence of imperfections (radiation
damage or hydration layer) influences the quality of diffraction signals, e.g.
the speckle contrast and noise level.
In both cases, we performed statistical analysis of the simulated diffraction
patterns as a function of the varied parameters pulse duration and hydration
layer thickness, respectively to gain more quantitative insight into the
dependency of diffraction data quality on these effects.

Fig.~\ref{fig:varcoeff} shows the coefficient of variation, a measure of
interpretability of single--particle diffraction patterns \cite{Yoon2016,Fortmann-Grote2017}
for \gls{fel} pulse durations of \SIlist{3;9;30}{\femto\second}. The larger
coefficients of variation found in the  \SI{3}{\femto\second} case indicating
poor data quality is due to the significantly lower photon flux at these
ultra--short pulses. This in turn comes from the intrinsic dependence of pulse
duration on the electron bunch charge \gls{fel}: Highly charged bunches,
producing a high photon flux, experience higher space charge effects and stronger longitudinal dispersion
leading to longer pulse durations.

varying pulse duration and photon flux. Figure taken from Ref.~\cite{Fortmann-Grote2017}.}
  \label{fig:varcoeff}
\end{figure}
%

Fig.~\ref{fig:R_value_hydration} shows the $R$--value for averaged simulated
diffraction patterns as a function of the hydration layer thickness. Radiation
damage has been neglected in these simulations to isolate the effect of the
water presence. $R < 0.2$ indicates good data quality allowing reconstruction of
the 3D electron density at resolution $d=2\pi/q$. Following this argument, the presence of a
\SI{3}{\angstrom} thick hydration layer would allow reconstruction on the level
of a few \si{\angstrom} length scales.

\section{Detector simulations\label{sec:detector_simulations}}
Simulations of measurable signals should not only take into account the
mechanism of x--ray scattering from the sample but also the response of the
detector to the scattered light impinging on the detector surface. So far, these
detector simulations have been missing in \textit{simex\_platform} for various technical reasons as
discussed e.g. in the EUCALL mid term report. These obstacles have now been
overcome. In the following, we present the implementation of detector
simulations in the simulation environment \textit{simex\_platform} followed by a first example simulation.

\section{Deviation from proposal}
As mentioned in the EUCALL mid term report, ELI's contributions to the SIMEX
work package were
re--defined: Within SIMEX, ELI focusses on the development of a simulation
pipeline for \gls{lpa} based coherent light sources. The progress is presented
in the Deliverable Report D4.3 \cite{EUCALL_SIMEX_D4.3}. The task ``signal
generation from plasma samples'' of D4.4  was assigned to HZDR, and the task
``signal generation from non--plasma samples'' was assigned to XFEL.
